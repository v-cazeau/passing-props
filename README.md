# Props in React

Boca Code Week 5 Passing Props: We focused on learning and practicing how to code with props in React. Props are used to pass data from one component to another in a React application, allowing for dynamic and reusable components. 

**Props are passed from the parent!**

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **App.js**: The main component that renders the app.
- **GreetingList.js**: Renders a list of greeting cards, demonstrating the usage of props.
- **GreetingCard.js**: Displays an individual greeting card, receiving data through props.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- React

## Getting Started

To run the project locally and explore the usage of props in React, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/[repository-url]).

2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Run the app using `npm start`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you will see a greeting list section with multiple greeting cards. Each greeting card represents an individual with a specific name and age. The data is passed to the greeting cards component using props.
